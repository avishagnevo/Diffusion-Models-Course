# Diffusion Models Course Homework

This repository hosts the materials for the Diffusion Models Course. All homework assignments should be submitted via Moodle.

## Homework Guidelines

- There will be 4-5 homework exercises. Homework must be submitted **individually**; submissions in pairs will not be accepted.
- Homework must be written in **Python**. Deep learning tasks should exclusively use **PyTorch**. Submissions using TensorFlow, Keras, Jax, etc. will receive a score of **0**.
- All code and answers to theoretical questions must be included in the provided notebook. Generated images should be submitted in a separate zip file. The naming format for code and zip files is:  
  `HW{#assignment}_{id}.{extension}`  
  Images within the zip file should be in **png** or **jpg** format.
- Grading will be based on both the correctness of the code and the quality of the outputs. Appeals should be sent via email to the homework grader. Appeals regarding the amount of points deducted will not be entertained.
- Questions about the homework will be answered only in the dedicated forum on Moodle. Emails to the course faculty regarding homework will not be answered.
- Unless explicitly stated, answers to questions in the forum apply to everyone and should be treated as an extension of the assignment's guidelines. It is recommended to review all forum questions before submission.
- For personal issues regarding the homework, please reach out to either TA by email.
